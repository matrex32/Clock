# Clock

This repository contains a simple, yet elegant, JavaScript clock that displays the current time in a 24-hour format. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the real-time capabilities of JavaScript when it comes to updating the time every second.

Features
Real-Time Updates: The clock updates every second, showing the current time without any need to refresh the page.
Minimalist Design: The clock features a large, easy-to-read display, styled with CSS for a clean and modern look.
Responsive: The layout is responsive, making it suitable for both desktop and mobile viewing.

Structure
index.html: The HTML file sets up the structure for the clock display and links to the CSS and JavaScript files.
style.css: This stylesheet contains the styles for the clock, ensuring the font is large and easily visible.
clock.js: The JavaScript file that contains the logic for updating the clock every second.

How It Works
The JavaScript function updateClock retrieves the current time, formats it to a 24-hour format with leading zeros, and updates the text content of the div with the id clock. Upon loading the page, updateClock is called to set the initial time, and a setInterval function is used to update the clock every 1000 milliseconds (1 second).
